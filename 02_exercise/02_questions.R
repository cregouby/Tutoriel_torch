# Luz model training : 
## Use {luz} to build and train a deep-neural network

## select one of the "basic" luz example from the luz website that relies on torchvision dataset
# what is the luz example you choose ?
# web link : 

## Datasets and loaders
# What is your dataset ?

# What is the size of your training set ?

# what transform is attached to the dataset ? 
# what does it do ?

# please print the first dataset item in the console

# describe this item (attributes, type, size, )

# how many classes are there in the dataset ? 


## Deep learning Network
# what is the number of parameters of the network ?
# answer: 
# command to get it : 

# What is the image size expected at the Network input ? (hard, you can skip) 

# If the network is a classifier, how many possible classes does the network output ?
