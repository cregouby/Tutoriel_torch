# torch setup

## What is the libtorch version of your installation
# tip : ?install_torch()

##  What are the available backend on your installation
# tip : bachend_xxx_is_available()



# tensor creation

## create tt1 : a random float tensor of uniform distribution and shape c(3,4)
# tip : is in the slides

## create tt2: a random float tensor of normal distribution and shape c(3,4,2)
# tip : is in the cheatsheat

## create tt3 : a random integer tensor of value between -3 ant 7 and shape c(2,3,4,2)
# tip : is in the cheatsheat


# tensor casting and moving

## move tt3 to the GPU (at least try)

## move the GPU tensor back to a R array

## cast the GPU tensor into a float tensor in the CPU



# tensor slicing

## slice the first 3 dimensions of tt3

## slice tt2 to its upper right corner of size c(2,2,2)
